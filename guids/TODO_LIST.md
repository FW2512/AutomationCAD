# Project TODOs

> This list is formatted for compatibility with the Todo Tree VS Code extension. Each task line includes the `TODO` keyword for tracking.

- TODO: Double bottom reinforcement bars  
- TODO: Add more color to layer & custom colors  
- TODO: Add transparency to layers  
- TODO: For errors reduction, must code file checker function to check for the necessary entries in JSON files before passing them to the main program  
- TODO: Handle the error when no AutoCAD task found (run the program while AutoCAD is not running)  
- TODO: For layers, names must be assignment entries (What if the user wants to change the layer name?). The layer name must not be hard-coded; add an assignment entry in the `layers_config.json` file  
- TODO: Do something for units  
- TODO: Add project name entry in JSON file so we don't draw on any open AutoCAD document
